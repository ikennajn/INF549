# DSCI-549
Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

I'm Meredith, the TA for DSCI-549. Pleased to meet you!

## Google Colab
I recommend [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for all your Jupyter Notebook needs for this class.

Google Colab is to Jupyter Notebooks as Google Docs is to Microsoft Word.

It has some advantages:
- all your packages for this class come preloaded
- I can easily troubleshoot with you
- It doesn't matter what operating system you are using

I wrote a guide on getting started [here](https://github.com/pointandclickinterface/guides/blob/main/GitHub-to-Colab.adoc) if you are confused. 

As you run these Notebooks make sure to take screenshot and answer the questions in a separate word doc!

## Running locally on Jupyter

For this class, I would not advise you to use Jupyter locally. I can not help you troubleshoot as easily, so your life may be more challenging. 
That said if you are up for a challange and want to do it locally, you can read my guide on that here.
